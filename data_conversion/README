This directory contains the programs used to extract PTHA data from TsuDAT1
so it can be inserted into the TsuDAT2 database.

To run this you need to have the TsuDAT1 data available somewhere.  Change
the path in the line in the Makefile that starts "DATAPATH=" to contain the path
to a TsuDAT1 "Tsu-DAT_Data" directory.  This path shoud point to a directory
containing the directory 'earthquake_data' as well as files such as 'return_periods.txt'.
Then run "make" which will execute all "make_*.py" programs.

The programs run and their output are described below.

make_event_2_subfaults.py
-------------------------
Program to create a file containing event ID to subfault ID mapping.  The
file produced is 'event_2_subfaults.csv' which contains the event ID in
column 1 and a list of subfault IDs in columns 2, 3, etc.

make_event_hp_wh.py
-------------------
Program that writes Tfile data as a file 'event_hp_wh.csv', which contains
rows: <eventID>,<hazard_pointID>,<wave_height>.

Rows with a zero waveheight or zero probability are not written.

make_hp_rp_fid_cc.py
--------------------
Writes a file "hp_rp_fid_cc.csv" that contains 'deag' data which specifies the
contribution for each subfault for all combinations of hazard point and return
period.  The file contains rows:
<hpID>,<rpID>,<sfltID>,<contrib>

Note: we do not write rows for which <contrib> is 0.0.  THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE.

make_hp_sflt_rp_wh.py
---------------------
Writes 'deag' data to a CSV file: <hpID>,<sfltID>,<rp>,<wh>
where <sfltID> is the subfault ID.  This data indicates the waveheight <wh> for
hazard point <hpID> due to subfault <sfltID> for return  period <rp>.

make_subfaultid_2_zonename.py
-----------------------------
Program that writes a file 'subfaultid_2_zonename.csv' that contains a mapping 
of subfault ID to zone name (<subfaultID>,<zone_nae>).

make_wh_cc_hp_file.py
---------------------
Program that reads the 'o_amp_green' file which contains a matrix with return
period and hazard point ID axes that contains the wave height.  The output is a
copy of 'o_amp_green' with a colour-code string replacing the wave height
values.  The file written is called "o_amp_green.cc".

make_zonename_2_subfault_posn.py
--------------------------------
A program that writes a file 'zonename_2_subfault_posn.csv' containing CSV data
"<zone_name>,<posn>,<posn>,..." where a <posn> is:  <lon>:<lat>.  This specifies
every subfault position for a zone.

run_all.py
----------
Is a program that runs all the above conversion programs in series.
You can change the path to mounted data here and it is passed to each
conversion program.


ursapi.py
---------
is a module used to access URS data.  This file and the one following are
part of the URSAPI system.

util.py
-------
a utility module for ursapi.py above.
