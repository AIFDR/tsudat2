To run a simulation, execute:
    # for Victor Harbour
    python make_fake_ui_files.VictorHarbour.sh	# if required
    python fake_ui_victor.py

    # for Batemans Bay
    python make_fake_ui_files.BatemansBay.sh	# if required
    python fake_ui_batemans.py

Design

The code here is used to run an ANUGA simulation.  The process that
starts the TsuDAT run is imagined to be something like this.

The front-end should create some sort of data file containing all
the UI data such as username, project, tide, etc.  This data contains 
boolean flags (such as 'extract depth of the water' from step 4),
lists of filenames for elevation, meshes, etc.  The data file should
probably be in json format (eg. data.json).  The only other real option
is a python import module and, since the file can be anywhere, is a
problem to import.

Any filenames in the json data file should be absolute paths to anywhere
in the filesystem.  Data files should have been translated to the pre-agreed
format.

Next, the UI code calls the make_tsudat_dir() function to create a working
directory structure.  The UI passes everything the function needs, like 
username, project, scenario, etc.  This function returns the absolute paths
to various places the UI code should place data files IF REQUIRED.  This 
need is yet to be determined.

IF REQUIRED, the UI code copies data files to places in the tsudat working
directories using the path(s) returned by mk_tsudat_dir().

Finally, the UI code calls the run_tsudat() function passing the absolute
path to the json data file.

The program fake_ui.py performs all the above and runs a simulation.  The
directory fake_ui_files contains all the data files the program needs to
provide for the simulation.

Random Thoughts
---------------
The run_tsudat.py and mk_tsudat_dir.py files need not be copied anywhere.
The design assumes there is only one copy of these files in the system.

The code under run_tsudat.py must merge the json data values into it's own 
fixed set of assumptions and run the simulation.

The make_fake_ui_files.*.sh scripts are used to create directories full
of data files that the fake_ui_*.py scripts use to run a simulation.
