The code here is used to run an ANUGA simulation.

The front-end should create some sort of data file containing all
the UI data such as username, project, tide, etc.  This data contains 
boolean flags (such as 'extract depth of the water' from step 4),
lists of filenames for elevation, meshes, etc.

The code under tsudat.py must merge the data values into it's own 
fixed set of assumptions (currently in project.py) and run the
simulation.

It is planned to pull all the code in files such as build_elevation.py
into tsudat.py.  These files are separate at the moment just because 
they originally were separate.

The get_timeseries.py code currently fails with a time sequence error.
Not worried about this art the moment.
